There are different properties of the density function that allows us to gain an understanding of the class under consideration. The most popular metrics are the&nbsp;<i style="box-sizing: border-box;">mean</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i style="box-sizing: border-box;">variance</i>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<i style="box-sizing: border-box;">covariance matrix</i>). In the case of normal densities, these two parameters completely characterize the density itself, and hence are denoted as the parameters of the density: N(mean,cov).</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; font-family: Raleway;">In this experiment, we will try to gain an understanding of these metrics. Specifically, we need to understand the effect of these parameters on the shape of the data distribution under various assumptions of densities. This will allow us to visualize the nature of distribution, given the mean vector and the covariance matrix.</p>
